## Cleanup Policy

- Generated inventories, giant code indexes, and transient run logs are removed from source control.
- Local execution artifacts belong under `artifacts/` and are git-ignored.
- Release evidence is staged under `docs/project-analysis/evidence/windows-release/` only when required for an actual release package.
