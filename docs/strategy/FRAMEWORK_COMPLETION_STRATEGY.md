# Framework Completion Strategy

## Recommended Order (Easiest to Hardest)

### Option 1: NIST 800-53 Rev 5 First ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Current:** 9/15 templates (60-75% coverage)
**Missing:** 3-6 core documents + 12 control families
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Why first?**
- Closest to completion
- FedRAMP templates can reuse NIST content
- Fastest win for demonstrating progress

### Option 2: ISO 27001:2022 First
**Current:** 14/24-30 templates (47-58% coverage)
**Missing:** 10-16 documents
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Why first?**
- Most widely recognized framework globally
- Strong market demand
- Clear mandatory requirements

### Option 3: FedRAMP First
**Current:** 7/14-18 templates (39-50% coverage)
**Missing:** 7-11 core documents + 9 attachments
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Why first?**
- Clear official templates from fedramp.gov
- US government contract requirement
- High-value enterprise customers

### Option 4: SOC 2 Type II First
**Current:** 12/25-35 templates (34-48% coverage)
**Missing:** 13-23 policies
**Effort:** 4-5 weeks
**Why first?**
- Highest market demand for SaaS companies
- Most comprehensive policy library
- Best for enterprise sales

## My Recommendation: Start with NIST 800-53 Rev 5

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ Quickest to complete (already 60-75% done)
2. ✅ Templates reusable for FedRAMP (FedRAMP is based on NIST)
3. ✅ Clear structure (20 control families)
4. ✅ Official NIST guidance available
5. ✅ Early win builds momentum

**Path to 100% NIST Coverage:**
- Week 1: Add 3 core documents (POA&M, SAR, PIA)
- Week 2: Add 6 control families (AT, CA, CP, MA, MP, PE)
- Week 3: Add 6 control families (PL, PM, PS, PT, SA, SR)
- **Result:** 100% NIST 800-53 Rev 5 coverage ✅

Then leverage NIST templates for FedRAMP completion (80% overlap).

## Which framework would you like to complete first?

1. NIST 800-53 Rev 5 (fastest, 2-3 weeks)
2. ISO 27001:2022 (most recognized, 3-4 weeks)
3. FedRAMP (government contracts, 3-4 weeks)
4. SOC 2 Type II (SaaS market, 4-5 weeks)
